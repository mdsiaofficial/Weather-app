Project - 2: Weather App

Overview:
This is a simple web application that allows users to check the weather of a specific city. The user can enter the name of the city in the search bar and click the search button. The application will then display the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed of the city. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The weather data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.


What i have learned:
I have learned how to create a simple weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a user-friendly format. I have also learned how to handle user input, make asynchronous requests, and update the DOM dynamically.
